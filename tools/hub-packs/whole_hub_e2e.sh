# The whole-hub end-to-end gate (CORPUS_HUB_V2 spec §12.4): run before tagging the
# release that advertises Hub v2.
#
#   whole_hub_e2e.sh --bin <xerj> --out <dir> [options]
#
# PRODUCTION MODE (the gate itself; the default)
#   --hub <url>          the hub (default https://hub.xerj.org). The client verifies
#                        the catalogue and every pack against the key compiled into
#                        <xerj>; XERJ_HUB_PUBKEY is never set.
#   --repo <owner/name>  where the pack releases live (default xerj-org/xerj); the
#                        catalogue's corpus count must equal the number of corpora
#                        with a published `pack-<slug>-<pin8>` release there.
#   --expect <n>         use n instead of counting releases (no GitHub API call).
#
# REHEARSAL MODE (before a signed catalogue is deployed)
#   --rehearse <tags>    comma list of published pack release tags. Their assets are
#                        downloaded and their REAL signatures checked against the
#                        embedded key (--pubkey); then, because the real seed is not
#                        available off CI, the packs are re-signed with a throwaway
#                        key, a catalogue of exactly those packs is built with
#                        `xerj hub build-catalogue` and served on loopback, and the
#                        client runs with XERJ_HUB_PUBKEY set to the throwaway key.
#   --registry <dir>     the hub registry (tools/xerj-code/hub on corpus-hub), and
#   --backlog <file>     its backlog-100.json: build-catalogue's inputs.
#   --assets <dir>       take the archives + .sig from here instead of downloading.
#
# BOTH MODES
#   --pubkey <hex>       the key the client embeds (default: HUB_PUBKEY_HEX from
#                        engine/crates/xerj-common/src/hub.rs in this checkout).
#   --questions <file>   the lz4 benchmark questions (default: e2e/lz4-questions.json).
#   --only <slugs>       restrict the per-corpus checks (a partial run never passes).
#   --strict             the final gate: a catalogued corpus with no published pack
#                        is a FAIL, not pending, and the catalogue count must equal
#                        the published-pack count. Default (backfill climbing): a
#                        not-yet-published corpus is pending, not a fail.
#   --batch <n>          corpora per fresh HOME + node (default 20).
#   --no-sandbox         run without bubblewrap (still an empty HOME and a cleared
#                        environment per phase). Default: every client phase runs in
#                        benchmarks/hub-pov/sandbox.sh (own PID namespace, read-only
#                        filesystem, a fresh HOME).
#   --run-id <id>        names the report rows (default: e2e-<UTC timestamp>).
#   --port <n>           loopback port for the local stand-in hub (default 19530;
#                        <n>+1 is used as a port nothing listens on).
#
# Some checks cannot use the real key in any mode: an over-the-cap entry and a
# tampered pack need a catalogue that says something the real one does not, so
# they run against copies of the verified catalogue edited and re-signed with a
# throwaway key (the `signatures` column of every check says which key it ran
# against). The tampered-CATALOGUE check uses the hub's own catalogue and
# signature, so in production mode it is a real-key check.
#
# GREEN CRITERIA (what has to hold for exit 0 — the release gate)
#   The gate is GREEN when ALL of these hold:
#     1. the catalogue loads, verifies against the client's embedded key, and
#        verifies independently with openssl;
#     2. every corpus with a PUBLISHED pack is in the catalogue (a published pack
#        that is not catalogued is a hard fail — users could not discover it);
#     3. every catalogued corpus that HAS a published pack passes pull + one --def
#        + one question (§12.3). A catalogued corpus whose pack is NOT published
#        yet is PENDING (skipped, reported, never a fail) — the backfill is still
#        climbing to 100% coverage; `--strict` turns pending into a fail;
#     4. the lz4 benchmark questions route and answer with no corpus named;
#     5. every documented failure path (hosted off/unreachable, offline,
#        over-the-auto-pull-cap, over-the-disk-budget) and both tamper checks give
#        their exact message and leave nothing extracted.
#   --strict additionally requires: 0 pending corpora, and the catalogue count to
#   equal the published-pack count (the spec §12.4 gate once the backfill is done).
#
# OUTPUT (in --out)
#   checks.jsonl   one {check, result, signatures, detail} line per gate check
#   rows/*.json    one backfill-report row per catalogued corpus (hub_packs.py
#                  `report --rows-dir` folds them into benchmarks/hub-backfill/).
#                  result is "e2e passed", "pending" (no published pack yet), or
#                  "failed" (a published corpus that did not answer).
#   GATE.md        the human summary (with the GREEN/RED verdict and these
#                  criteria); homes/<phase>/ every phase's HOME and logs
# Exit 0 only when the gate is GREEN by the criteria above.
#
# Never point --hub, XERJ_URL or anything else here at a node you care about: each
# client phase starts its own node (the automatic node, port >= 9300) in its own
# HOME, and stops exactly that node when the phase ends.
